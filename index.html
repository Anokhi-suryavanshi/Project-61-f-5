        <p>“ For me Cooking is like a art and it is fun doing it.Cooking is like love. It should be entered into with abandon or not at all.”
            – Harriet Van Horne


            “A recipe has no soul. You as the cook must bring soul to the recipe.”
            – Thomas Keller


            “Cooking is like painting or writing a song. Just as there are only so many notes or colors, there are only so many flavors—it’s how you combine them that sets you apart.”
            – Wolfgang Puck


            “If you are a chef, no matter how good a chef you are, it’s not good cooking for yourself; the joy is in cooking for others. It’s the same with music.”
            – will.i.am


            “Cooking with kids is not just about ingredients, recipes, and cooking. It’s about harnessing imagination, empowerment, and creativity.”
            – Guy Fieri


            “Real cooking is more about following your heart than following recipes.”
            – Unknown


            “Cooking is at once child’s play and adult joy. And cooking done with care is an act of love.”
            – Craig Claiborne</p>
